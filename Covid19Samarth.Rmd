```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

# Getting Started
## Downloading and Importing Up-To-Date COVID-19 Data

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
rpath1 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-states.csv"
usstates = read.csv(rpath1)
```

## Make a copy

```{r}
dat_state = usstates
head(dat_state)
```

## Define Date Variable and Data Frame


```{r}
dat_state$date <- as.Date(dat_state$date)
dat_state <- arrange(dat_state,state,date)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
